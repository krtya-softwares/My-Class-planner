    <td colspan="2" align="justify"><p> Food is one of the basic requirements of all living organisms. The major components of our food are carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Vitamins and minerals are also required in small quantities. Food provides energy and organic materials for growth and repair of tissues. The water we take in, plays an important role in metabolic processes and also prevents dehydration of the body. Biomacromolecules in food cannot be utilised by our body in their original form. They have to be broken down and converted into simple substances in the digestive system. This process of conversion of complex food substances to simple absorbable forms is called digestion and is carried out by our digestive system by mechanical and biochemical methods. General organisation of the human digestive system is shown in Figure 16.1.</p>
      <h1>16.1 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM </h1>
      The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and the associated glands.
      <h2>16.1.1 Alimentary Canal </h2>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The alimentary canal begins with an anterior opening ñ the mouth, and it opens out posteriorly through the anus. The mouth leads to the buccal cavity or oral cavity. The oral cavity has a number of teeth and a muscular tongue. Each tooth is embedded in a socket of jaw bone (Figure16.2). This type of attachment is called thecodont. Majority of mammals including human being forms two sets of teeth during their life, a set of </td>

  <tr>
    <td align="justify"> temporary milk or  deciduous teeth replaced by  a set of permanent or adult teeth. This type of dentition is called diphyodont. An adult human has 32  permanent teeth which are of four different types (Heterodont dentition), namely, incisors (I), canine (C), premolars (PM) and molars (M). Arrangement of teeth in each half  of the upper and lower jaw in the order I, C, PM,  M is  represented by  a dental formula which in  human is 2123/2123 . The hard chewing surface of the teeth, made up of enamel, helps
      in the mastication of food.  The tongue is a freely movable muscular organ
      attached to the floor of the oral cavity by the frenulum. The upper surface of the tongue has small projections called papillae, some of which bear taste buds. <br/>
      <br/>
      The oral cavity leads into a short pharynx which serves as a common
      passage for  food  and air. The  oesophagus and the trachea (wind pipe) 
      
      
      open into the pharynx. A cartilaginous flap called epiglottis prevents the entry of food into the glottis ñ opening of the wind pipe ñ during  swallowing. The  oesophagus is  a thin, long  tube which extends posteriorly passing through  the neck, thorax and diaphragm and leads to a ëJí shaped bag like structure  called stomach. A  muscular sphincter (gastro-oesophageal) regulates the opening of oesophagus into the stomach. The   stomach,  located in  the upper left portion of the abdominal cavity, has three major parts ñ a cardiac portion into which the oesophagus opens, a fundic region and a pyloric portion which opens into the first part of small intestine (Figure 16.3). Small intestine is  distinguishable  into three regions, a ëUí  shaped duodenum, a long coiled middle portion jejunum and a highly coiled ileum. The  opening of the stomach into the duodenum is guarded by the pyloric sphincter.  Ileum opens into the  large intestine. It consists of caecum, colon and rectum. Caecum is a small blind sac which hosts some symbiotic micro-organisms. A narrow finger -like  tubular projection, the vermiform appendix  which is  a vestigial organ, arises from the caecum. The caecum opens into the colon. The  colon is  divided into three parts ñ an ascending, a transverse and a descending part. The descending part opens into the rectum which opens out through the anus. <br/>
      <br/>
      The   wall   of  alimentary canal  from oesophagus to rectum possesses four layers (Figure 16.4) namely serosa, muscularis, sub-mucosa and mucosa. Serosa is  the outermost layer and is  made up of a thin mesothelium (epithelium of visceral organs) with some connective tissues. Muscularis is formed by smooth muscles usually arranged into an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer. An oblique muscle layer may be  present in  some regions. The  sub- mucosal layer is formed of loose connective </td>

    <td align="justify">tissues  containing nerves, blood and  lymph vessels. In duodenum, glands are also present in sub-mucosa. The   innermost  layer lining the lumen of the alimentary canal is the mucosa. This layer forms irregular folds (rugae) in the stomach and small finger-like foldings called villi in  the small intestine (Figure 16.5). The cells lining the villi produce numerous microscopic projections called microvilli giving  a brush border appearance.  These modifications increase  the surface area enormously. Villi are supplied with a network of capillaries and a large lymph vessel called the lacteal. Mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete mucus that help in lubrication. Mucosa also forms glands in the stomach (gastric glands) and crypts in between the bases of villi in the intestine (crypts of Lieberkuhn). All the four layers show modifications in different parts of the alimentary canal. <br/>
      <br/></td>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" align="justify"><b>16.1.2  Digestive Glands</b><br/>
      <br/>
      The  digestive glands associated with the alimentary canal include the salivary glands, the liver and the pancreas. <br/>
      <br/>
      Saliva is mainly produced by three pairs of salivary glands, the parotids (cheek), the sub-maxillary/sub-mandibular  (lower  jaw)  and the sub- linguals (below the tongue). These glands situated just outside the buccal cavity secrete salivary juice into the buccal cavity. <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>Liver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2  to 1.5  kg in an adult human. It is situated in  the abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm and has two lobes. The hepatic lobules are the structural and functional units of liver  containing hepatic cells arranged in the form of cords. Each lobule is covered by a thin connective tissue sheath called the Glissonís capsule. The bile secreted by the hepatic cells passes through the hepatic ducts and is stored and concentrated in a thin muscular sac called the gall  bladder. The  duct of gall  bladder (cystic duct) along with the hepatic duct from the liver forms the common bile duct (Figure 16.6).</p>
      <br />
      <img src="16_6.png" alt="" width="499" height="350" /><br />
      <br />
      The bile duct and the pancreatic duct open together into the duodenum as the common hepato-pancreatic duct which is guarded by a sphincter called the sphincter of Oddi
      <p> The pancreas is a compound (both exocrine and endocrine) elongated organ situated  between the limbs of the ëUí  shaped duodenum. The exocrine portion secretes an alkaline pancreatic juice containing enzymes and the endocrine portion secretes hormones, insulin and glucagon. </p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><b>16.2    DIGESTION OF  FOOD</b> <br/>
      <br/>
      The  process of digestion is accomplished by  mechanical and chemical processes. <br/>
      <br/>
      The buccal cavity performs two major functions, mastication of food and facilitation of swallowing. The teeth and the tongue with the help of 
      
      saliva masticate and mix up the food thoroughly. Mucus in saliva helps in lubricating and adhering the masticated food  particles into a bolus. The bolus is then conveyed into the pharynx and then into the oesophagus by swallowing or deglutition. The  bolus further passes down through the oesophagus by  successive waves of muscular contractions called peristalsis. The gastro-oesophageal sphincter controls the passage of food into the stomach.The saliva secreted into the oral cavity contains electrolytes                                 and  enzymes, salivary amylase and lysozyme. The chemical process of digestion is initiated in the oral cavity by the hydrolytic action of the carbohydrate splitting enzyme, the salivary amylase. About 30  per  cent of starch is hydrolysed here by this enzyme (optimum pH  6.8)  into a disaccharide ñ maltose. L ysozyme present in saliva acts as an antibacterial agent that prevents infections. <br/>

      The mucosa of stomach has gastric glands. Gastric glands have three major types of cells namely - <br/>
      <br/>
      (i) mucus neck cells which secrete mucus; <br/>
      (ii) peptic or chief cells which secrete the proenzyme pepsinogen; and <br/>
      (iii) parietal or  oxyntic cells which secrete HCl  and intrinsic factor <br/>
      (factor essential for absorption of vitamin B12). </td>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" align="justify"><p> The stomach stores the food for 4-5 hours. The food mixes thoroughly with the acidic gastric juice of the stomach by the churning movements of its muscular wall and is called the <b>chyme </b>. The proenzyme pepsinogen, on  exposure to hydrochloric acid gets converted into the active enzyme pepsin, the proteolytic enzyme of the stomach. Pepsin converts proteins into proteoses and peptones (peptides). The  mucus and bicarbonates present in  the gastric juice play an important role  in  lubrication and protection of  the mucosal epithelium from excoriation by  the highly concentrated  hydrochloric acid. HCl  provides the acidic pH  (pH  1.8) optimal for pepsins. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice of infants which helps in the digestion of milk proteins. Small amounts of lipases are also secreted by gastric glands. </p>
      <br/>
      Various types of movements are generated by the muscularis layer of the small intestine. These movements help in a thorough mixing up of the food  with various secretions in  the intestine and thereby facilitate digestion. The  bile,   pancreatic juice and the intestinal juice are the secretions released into the small intestine. Pancreatic juice and bile are released through the hepato-pancreatic duct. The  pancreatic juice contains  inactive enzymes ñ  trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidases, amylases, lipases and nucleases. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme, enterokinase, secreted by the intestinal mucosa <br/>
      into active trypsin, which in  turn activates the other enzymes in  the pancreatic juice. The  bile  released into the duodenum contains bile pigments  (bilirubin and  bili-verdin), bile   salts,  cholesterol and phospholipids but no  enzymes. Bile helps in emulsification of fats, i.e., breaking down of the fats into very small micelles. Bile also activates lipases. <br/>
      <br/>
      The intestinal mucosal epithelium has <b> goblet cells </b> which secrete mucus. The  secretions of the brush border cells of the mucosa alongwith the secretions  of  the  goblet cells constitute  the  intestinal  juice or <b> succus  entericus </b>.  This juice contains a variety of  enzymes like disaccharidases (e.g.,  maltase), dipeptidases, lipases, nucleosidases, etc. The  mucus alongwith the bicarbonates from the pancreas protects the intestinal mucosa from acid as well as provide an alkaline medium (pH
      7.8) for enzymatic activities. Sub-mucosal glands (Brunnerís glands) also help in this. <br/>
      <br/>
      Proteins, proteoses and peptones (partially hydrolysed proteins) in the chyme reaching the intestine are acted upon by  the proteolytic enzymes of pancreatic juice as given below: <br/></td>

    The breakdown of biomacromolecules mentioned above occurs in the duodenum region of the small intestine. The  simple substances thus formed are absorbed in  the jejunum and ileum regions of the small intestine. The undigested and unabsorbed substances are passed on to the large intestine. <br/><br/>
No  significant digestive activity occurs in  the large intestine. The functions of large intestine are:
(i) absorption of some water, minerals and certain drugs; <br/>
(ii) secretion of mucus which helps in adhering the waste (undigested)<br/>
particles together and lubricating it for an easy passage.<br/><br/>
The undigested, unabsorbed substances called faeces enters into the caecum of the large intestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back flow of the faecal matter.  It is temporarily stored in the rectum till defaecation.<br/>
The  activities of  the gastro-intestinal tract are under neural and
hormonal control for  proper coordination of different parts. The  sight, smell and/or the presence of food  in  the oral cavity can stimulate the secretion of saliva. Gastric and intestinal secretions are also, similarly, stimulated by neural signals. The muscular activities of different parts of the alimentary canal can also be moderated by neural mechanisms, both local and through CNS.  Hormonal control of the secretion of digestive juices is  carried out by  local hormones produced by  the gastric and intestinal mucosa.<br/><br/>

    <td colspan="2" align="justify"> <b> 16.3  ABSORPTION OF  DIGESTED PRODUCTS </b><br/><br/>
    Absorption is the process by which the end products of digestion pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood or lymph. It is carried out by passive, active or facilitated transport mechanisms. Small amounts of monosaccharides like  glucose, amino acids and some electrolytes like chloride ions are generally absorbed by simple diffusion. The passage of these substances  into the blood depends upon the concentration gradients. However, some of the substances like fructose and some amino acids are absorbed with the help of  the carrier ions like  Na+. This mechanism is called the facilitated transport.

    Transport  of  water depends upon the osmotic gradient. Active transport occurs against the concentration gradient and hence requires energy. Various nutrients like amino acids, monosaccharides like glucose, electrolytes like Na+ are absorbed into the blood by this mechanism.<br/>
Fatty acids and glycerol being insoluble, cannot be absorbed into the blood. They are first incorporated into small droplets called micelles which move into the intestinal mucosa. They are re-formed into very small protein coated fat  globules called the chylomicrons which are transported into the lymph vessels (lacteals) in the villi. These lymph vessels ultimately release the absorbed substances into the blood stream. <br/>
Absorption of substances takes place in different parts of the alimentary canal, like mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. However, maximum absorption occurs in  the small intestine. A summary of absorption (sites of  absorption and substances  absorbed) is  given in Table 16.1 <br/>

<i>Jaundice</i>: The  liver  is  affected, skin and eyes turn yellow  due to  the deposit of bile pigments.

<i>Vomiting</i>: It is the ejection of stomach contents through the mouth. This reflex action is controlled by the vomit centre in the medulla. A feeling of nausea precedes vomiting.<br/><br/>

<i>Diarrhoea</i>: The abnormal frequency of bowel movement and increased liquidity of the faecal discharge is known as diarrhoea.  It reduces the absorption of food.<br/><br/>

<i>Constipation</i>: In constipation, the faeces are retained within the rectum as the bowel movements occur irregularly.<br/><br/>

<i>Indigestion</i>: In this condition, the food is not properly digested leading to a feeling of fullness. The  causes of indigestion are inadequate enzyme secretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating, and spicy food.<br/>
