The digestive system of humansconsists of an alimentary canal and associated digestive glands. The alimentarycanal consists of the mouth, buccal cavity,pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, smallintestine, large intestine, rectum and the anus. The accessory digestive glandsinclude the salivary glands, the liver (withgall bladder) and the pancreas.Inside the mouth the teeth masticates the food, the tongue tastes the food andmanipulates it for proper mastication by mixing with the saliva. Salivacontains a starch digestive enzyme, salivary amylase that digests the starchand converts it into maltose (disaccharide). The food then passes into thepharynx and enters the oesophagus in the form of bolus, which is further carrieddown through the oesophagus by peristalsis into the stomach. In stomach mainlyprotein digestion takes place. Absorption of simple sugars, alcohol and medicinesalso takes place in the stomach. The chyme (food) enters into the duodenumportion of the small intestine and is acted on by the pancreatic juice, bileand finally by the enzymes in the succus entericus, so that the digestion ofcarbohydrates, proteins and fats is completed. The food then enters into thejejunum and ileum portions of the small intestine. Carbohydrates are digestedand converted into monosaccharides like glucose. Proteins are finally brokendown into amino acids. The fats are converted to fatty acids and glycerol. Thedigested end products are absorbed into the body through the epithelial liningof the intestinal villi. The undigested food (faeces) enters into the caecum ofthe large intestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back flow ofthe faecal matter. Most of the water is absorbed in the large intestine. Theundigested food becomes semi-solid in nature and then enters into the rectum,anal canal and is finally egested out through the anus.
